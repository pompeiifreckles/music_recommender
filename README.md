This is still quite a poor representation of the actual thing, but still it proves the\
point (This was a late night project and I was very sleepy, excuse my poor code 0w0 )\

## Further things to integrate
- [x] - euclidean distance
- [ ] - hamming distance
- [ ] - cosine distance
- [ ] - manhattan distance

Using aubio library for audio signal processing to extract the parameters from the tracks.
